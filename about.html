      <h2><span>Comfrey Leaves</span></h2>
      <p>
        Comfrey roots and leaves contain allantoin, a substance that helps
        promote cell growth as well as inhibiting infect and reduce inflammation
        in all tissues, particularly skin tissues. This makes it a go-to for
        things like cuts, bruises, stings, dry skin, eczema, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        Comfrey is also known as "Bone Knit". It earned the nickname because it
        has been used for centuries to speed the healing of bone injuries. Its
        calcium combined with allantoin helps to speed the body’s recovery from
        injury and damage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Comfrey ointments and salves like ours have been used to heal pulled
        muscles and ligaments, fractures, sprains, strains, and osteoarthritis.

    <div id="pepp" class="ing pepp">
      <h2><span>Peppermint Leaves</span></h2>
      <p>
        Many types of mint have been used since ancient times to treat
        skin-related problems like acne and scars because of their powerful
        antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. The
        richness of menthol and natural antioxidants in mint leaves are used as
        an amazing cleanser, toner, astringent, and moisturizer for the skin.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mint leaves are especially effective in treating acne. They lower
        inflammation, tone the skin, and soothe dry or itchy skin. Mint leaves
        also contain high salicylic acid and vitamin A which control the
        secretion of sebum oil in the skin and help to prevent acne.
        <br />
        <br />
        We use peppermint leaves mainly for the oil that they secrete.
        Peppermint oil is not only anti-inflammatory but also analgesic. It is
        also effective in increasing circulation. These properties make our
        salve beneficial for muscle pain, inflamed joints, and arthritis.

    <div id="oil" class="ing oil">
      <h2><span>Olive Oil</span></h2>
      <p>
        Olive oil contains squalene and vitamin E. Squalene supports the skin’s
        moisture retention, whereas vitamin E increases the skin's capacity to
        absorb and retain water, both elements working together to improve the
        moisturization of your skin.
        <br />
        <br />
        Olive oil is also rich in antioxidants. These compounds can combat
        oxidative stress, which is associated with skin aging. They can also
        increase collagen in the skin. Olive oil has anti-inflammatory and
        antimicrobial properties, which can also aid in wound healing.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because like attracts like, olive oil can be used to dissolve oily
        residue on the skin. This is what makes our salve effective for removing
        certain types of makeup (particularly waterproof products).

      <h2><span>Beeswax</span></h2>
      <p>
        Without clogging the pores and preventing the skin from being able to
        breathe, Beeswax's anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects help create
        a protective barrier for the skin against harmful bacteria as well as
        the harsh effects of the elements.
        <br />
        <br />
        Beeswax is also known to help decrease the irritation, redness, and
        inflammation characteristics of acne, while its anti-septic effect
        further facilitates the healing process. Beeswax has a similar effect on
        skin afflicted with eczema and psoriasis, soothing the itchiness and
        working to prevent further irritation or infection.
        <br />
        <br />
        By promoting the growth of newer skin and by contributing softness,
        Beeswax may also diminish the appearance of spots, wrinkles, and scars.

      <h2><span>Lavender Essential Oil</span></h2>
      <p>
        The scent of lavender is widely known to be soothing and relaxing.
        However, lavender also has many other health benefits.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lavender can be used for nearly all skin conditions. It can be applied
        to cuts, sunburns, rashes, dermatitis, eczema, and insect bites.
        Consistent use of lavender with burns and injuries minimizes scarring.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lavender is antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, cytophylactic, and
        antispasmodic, making it effective for muscle strains and sprains,
        cramps, and wound healing.

    <div id="ttree" class="ing ttree">
      <h2><span>Tea Tree Esstential Oil</span></h2>
      <p>
        Tea tree has been in use as an antiseptic for centuries. It was used by
        soldiers and sailors in World War II in the treatment of topical
        infections.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tea tree essential oil is effective against some of the nastiest
        microbes on the planet. Tea tree can prevent sepsis in wounds and be
        used to treat wounds, boils, sores, cuts, insect bites, and stings.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tea tree is also a mild tissue regenerator, making it a good choice for
        rashes, nail or skin fungal infections, wounds, cold sores, acne,
        athlete's foot, and ringworm.
