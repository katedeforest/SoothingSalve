      <h2><span>Comfrey Leaves</span></h2>
      <p>
        Comfrey roots and leaves contain allantoin, a substance that helps
        promote cell growth as well as inhibiting infection and reducing
        inflammation in all tissues, particularly skin tissues. This makes it a
        go-to for things like cuts, bruises, stings, dry skin, eczema, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        Comfrey is also known as "Bone Knit". It earned the nickname because it
        has been used for centuries to speed the healing of bone injuries. Its
        calcium combined with allantoin helps to speed the body’s recovery from
        injury and damage.
        <br />
        Comfrey ointments and salves have been used to heal pulled muscles and
        ligaments, fractures, sprains, strains, and osteoarthritis.

      <h2><span>Peppermint Leaves</span></h2>
      <p>
        When used in our recipe, peppermint leaves secret peppermint oil which
        has many beneficial properties. peppermint has antibacterial and
        antifungal properties.
        <br />
        <!-- Components found in peppermint may protect the skin from certain harmful
        chemicals. Peppermint has soothing and relieving properties in essential
        oil form, and it's possible it can protect the skin and work as an
        effective topical ointment in small concentrations.  -->
        <br />
        <!-- Peppermint shows some promise in protecting the skin in low
        concentrations, but it can also harm the skin if applied in high
        amounts. This depends on many factors including each person’s
        sensitivity to topical products and any allergies they may have. -->
        <br />
        <!-- For the most part, -->
        peppermint leaves also contain antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals
        <!-- which can help the body feel at its best.  -->
        Similar to aloe, they can potentially reduce redness and promote healthy
        skin due to their anti-inflammatory and soothing properties. 
        <br />
        Mint is an ancient medicine to treat skin related problems like acne and
        scars. The powerful antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory
        properties of mint leaves are effective in treating acne and lowers the
        inflammation and redness associated with acne outbursts.
        <br />
        Mint leaves contain high salicylic acid and vitamin A which controls the
        secretion of sebum oil in the skin and helps to cure acne.
        <br />
        Mint leaves extract is useful to treat and prevent acne. The richness of
        menthol and natural antioxidants in mint leaves are used as an amazing
        cleanser, toner, astringent and moisturizer for the skin. Mint leaves
        tones the skin, softens dry and itchy skin.

    <div id="oil" class="ing oil">
      <h2><span>Olive Oil</span></h2>
      <p>
        Moisturizes the skin: Olive oil contains squalene and vitamin E.
        Squalene supports the skin’s moisture retention, whereas vitamin E
        increases the skin's capacity to absorb and retain water.3
        <br />
        Reduces the signs of aging: Olive oil is rich in antioxidants. These
        compounds can combat oxidative stress, which is associated with skin
        aging. They can also increase collagen in the skin.1
        <br />
        Helps cleanse the skin: Because like attracts like, olive oil can be
        used to dissolve oily residue on the skin. That said, it can be used to
        remove certain types of makeup—particularly waterproof products.4
        <br />
        Promotes wound healing: Olive oil also has anti-inflammatory and
        antimicrobial properties, which can aid in wound healing. Studies show
        that olive oil may be able to promote healing of diabetic foot ulcers
        and prevent pressure ulcers.

    <div id="wax" class="ing wax">
      <h2><span>Beeswax</span></h2>
      <p>
        Used cosmetically, such as in lip products, moisturizers, and eye
        makeup, Beeswax hydrates, conditions, soothes, and calms the skin.
        Without clogging the pores and preventing the skin from being able to
        breathe, Beeswax creates a hydrating, long-lasting protective barrier to
        protect it against environmental pollutants as well as the harsh effects
        of the elements. Its exfoliating and reparative properties combined with
        its vitamin content helps promote the skin’s regeneration and
        rejuvenation by helping diminish the appearance of the signs of aging,
        including spots, wrinkles, and skin damage.
        <br />
        Refreshing, restorative, and gentle enough for use on even the most
        sensitive skin, Beeswax is known to soothe itchiness and irritation, to
        nourish, and to soften dry, cracked, broken areas, making it ideal for
        use in lip balms.
        <br />
        Its regenerative quality and anti-inflammatory property work in
        conjunction to help decrease the irritation, redness, and inflammation
        characteristic of acne, while its anti-septic effect further facilitates
        the healing process. Beeswax has a similar effect on skin afflicted with
        eczema and psoriasis, soothing the itchiness and working to prevent
        further irritation or infection. By promoting the growth of newer skin
        and by contributing softness, Beeswax leaves the complexion looking
        renewed. When applied to stretch marks, whether they are caused by a
        fluctuation in weight or by pregnancy, Beeswax is known to help diminish
        the appearance of these often-unwanted marks, when used in combination
        with carrier oils and butters.
        <br />
        Used medicinally, Beeswax makes an ideal ingredient in salves meant for
        treating scrapes, minor cuts, minor wounds, and burns, among other
        abrasions. Its anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects help to prevent
        harmful bacteria from entering the body through chapped and broken skin,
        which is especially common in dry climates and which makes it valuable
        for use during the drier times of the year. By providing the skin with a
        layer of protection against external irritants, including harsh and
        extreme weather conditions that can cause roughness and dryness, Beeswax
        moisturizes the skin to restore its natural radiance and smoothness. The
        antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Beeswax also benefit
        those who suffer from topical allergies or other discomforts, such as
        eczema and rosacea.

      <h2><span>Lavender Essential Oil</span></h2>
      <p>
        The scent of lavender is widely known to be soothing and relaxing.
        However, lavender also has many other health benefits.
        <br />
        Lavender can be used for nearly all skin conditions. It can be applied
        to cuts, sunburns, rashes, dermatitis, eczema, and insect bites.
        Consistent use of lavender with burns and injuries minimizes scarring.
        <br />
        Lavender is antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, cytophylactic, and
        antispasmodic, making it effective for muscle strains and sprains,
        cramps, and wound healing.

    <div id="ttree" class="ing ttree">
      <h2><span>Tea Tree Esstential Oil</span></h2>
      <p>
        Tea tree has been in use as an antiseptic for centuries. It was used by
        soldiers and sailors in World War II in the treatment of topical
        infections.
        <br />
        Tea tree essential oil is effective against some of the nastiest
        microbes on the planet. Tea tree can prevent sepsis in wounds and it can
        be used to treat wounds, boils, sores, cuts, insect bites, and stings.
        <br />
        Tea tree is also a mild tissue regenerator, making it a good choice for
        rashes, nail or skin fungal infections, wounds, cold sores, acne,
        athlete's foot, and ringworm.
